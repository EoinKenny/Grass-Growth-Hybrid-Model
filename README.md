# Grass-Growth-Hybrid-Model

This is a repo to show a basic pipeline of our hybrid model for grass-growth prediction.

We have randomized the "sample_data.csv" to protect privacy, and you will need a mechanistic model to complete the pipeline.

However, we have included the machine learning model, data scaler, and screening model (trained on randomized data to again preserve privacy).
